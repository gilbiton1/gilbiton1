# 👋 Hi, I'm Gil Biton

I'm a Data Scientist with an M.Sc. in Data Science (Research Track), specializing in machine learning solutions for real-world healthcare data.

 I focus on building robust and interpretable ML pipelines – from raw data to production-ready models.

##  Areas of Expertise

-  **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** – XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, MLP, Transformers
-  **Time Series Analysis** – Temporal feature engineering, forecasting, multi-year prediction frameworks
-  **Clinical & Real-World Data** – EHR processing, advanced imputation, concept drift detection
-  **Computer Vision** – Image classification and segmentation for manufacturing defect detection (WAFER)
-  **Feature Selection & Interpretability** – Welch’s t-test, Cohen’s d, SHAP, clustering-based selection

##  Featured Projects

-  [**Early Prediction of Prediabetes**](https://github.com/gilbiton1/prediabetes-thesis)  
  Full ML pipeline on real EHR data: data preprocessing, temporal feature selection (t-test, bootstrapping, effect sizes), multi-year modeling (XGBoost, RF, MLP), Optuna-based hyperparameter tuning, and clinical insight extraction.

-  [**Manufacturing Defect Detection – WAFER Project**](https://github.com/gilbiton1/wafer-defect-detection)  
  ML pipeline for semiconductor scratch classification based on tabular and visual features. Includes feature engineering (spatial, neighborhood-based), class imbalance handling, model evaluation.

-  [**MobileBERT + LoRA Fine-Tuning**](https://github.com/gilbiton1/mobilebert-lora)  
  Efficient transformer fine-tuning using LoRA on the GLUE and BoolQ tasks, with extensive NLP data augmentation.

-  [**Stock Price Prediction - Time Series Analysis**](https://github.com/gilbiton1/stock-price-prediction)

  Built a hybrid model for stock price direction forecasting by combining XGBoost with sequence similarity methods (DTW, SAX).
  The approach integrates co-integrated stock data, nearest-neighbor pattern detection to capture both global trends and local temporal patterns.
